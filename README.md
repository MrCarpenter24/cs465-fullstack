CS-465 Full Stack with MEAN - SNHU Portfolio Artifact

In the full stack project, I worked with a few different types of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a Single-Page Application (SPA) using Angular. Express HTML is great for server-side rendering, but it’s a bit more basic and doesn’t offer the interactivity you get with JavaScript. JavaScript was key in making the pages more dynamic and responsive to user actions. The SPA, built with Angular, really stood out because it allowed the app to run smoothly without full-page reloads, making the user experience much more fluid and seamless compared to the older multi-page setups.

On the backend, was a NoSQL MongoDB database. The choice was mainly because MongoDB is good at handling lots of unstructured data and offers the flexibility to adapt as the app grows and changes, which is perfect for managing the various types of travel-related information needed.

JSON was essential in connecting the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is used within the app to manipulate data and create interactive features, JSON serves as the format for exchanging data between Angular and Express. It’s lightweight and easy to work with, which made it ideal for keeping everything in sync across the frontend and backend.

Throughout the development, I found myself refactoring code to make it more efficient and easier to manage. For instance, optimizing how API calls were handled and reducing repeated code really improved the app’s performance. The use of reusable UI components was also a game-changer. It allowed me to maintain a consistent look and feel across the app while also speeding up the development process because I could reuse components in multiple places.

When it came to testing, I had to be thorough, especially with API endpoints. I used methods like GET and POST to ensure data was being handled correctly. Testing was a bit more complex due to the security layers we added, like JWT authentication. This required us to validate tokens and make sure data was transmitted securely, which added an extra layer of challenge but was crucial for protecting user data.

Looking back, this course has really helped me grow in my professional journey. I’ve gained hands-on experience with full stack development using the MEAN stack, which has boosted my confidence in building scalable, responsive web applications. The skills I’ve developed, like API design and frontend-backend integration, will definitely make me a stronger candidate in the tech industry.
